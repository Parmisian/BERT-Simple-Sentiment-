       "[\"Toluna is consistent in providing me relevant surveys. I have been enjoying your site even i don't get to complete a survey by playing games - wheel and match games, and voting in the quick surveys. Just two things for Toluna to look into: faster redemption process (3 days would be nice) and coming up with contests. By the way, i noticed lately that there is a survey compensation of 50 ( to 70 points) for uncompleted surveys. Thank you for this added feature as well. Keep up the good work. \",\n",
       " 'Just started using it. I like that you still get points when you don’t qualify for a survey, however there seems to be a large amount of surveys I do not qualify for. In addition, the “recommended” surveys aren’t always still available. Again, I just started using and 4 surveys I tried to complete were no longer available. I have only qualified and completed 1 full survey out of the many I’ve tried.',\n",
       " 'You got four because of the numbers of e-mails I get claiming to tell me about an available survey, but when I go to the site there is no survey.  If not for that you would have got 5 stars.  The service you provide is otherwise excellent.  I am pleased to see that, following my comment about spending time answering questions only to be told you are not right for the survey, we now get a small number of points for this.  Thank you for listening.',\n",
       " 'Most of the survey invitations are genuine (unlike other companies) and while it takes a while to build up to some cash all the surveys are interesting and not overly long. Payment once you reach the limit is prompt to Paypal.',\n",
       " 'An excellent site to go onto for surveys. It would be better if the gift cards were easier to download though. Under the current system I have to write out the entire https:// address and sometimes it does not work right. For that reason, I gave it lower stars than I normally would.',\n",
       " 'The platform  has fun and relevant surveys that I enjoy and mostly learn more. Rewards are good makes me happy everytime I get that notification that I got paid. Great platform love it.. ',\n",
       " 'all in all, i generally like the toluna website. the amount of points i get for each survey is fair and reasonable and the games are fun, simple and basic. however, the amount of points required to cahsout a reward is a bit much and it could be lowered. other than that no complaints. ',\n",
       " 'Toluna suspended my account without me being aware and I was so excited about earning points. When I had inquired as to why, they said I had violated terms and conditions…which I don’t even think I did! No other explanation. I’m furious I wasted my time. I’m a mother to a 10 month old, I’m just trying to help my husband…I don’t have time to waste!',\n",
       " \"Good choice of surveys but sometimes the site won't let me get in or the survey stops working halfway through or there is not any surveys when I log on.\",\n",
       " \"Toluna is the best survey site around, they have a lot of survey's about all sort of topics which keep me interested and that makes me want to stay with them\",\n",
       " 'Too often, we start a survey that ends in “Sorry, we are looking another profile”I also found that very often the website doesn’t work. A couple of times, I had started a survey and when I was not far from the end, the page stopped working. Very disappointing and such a waste of my time.I don’t think it is worth it really, because to earn a tiny bit of money, you have to spend many many hours answering the questions. I understand that it is easy money and it shouldn’t be too “easy” but still, a bit more rewarding points would be more motivating.',\n",
       " \"it's great even i am always failed to proceed the survey i don't why you're always saying im not qualified but still im always trying. Thanks\",\n",
